    note: >
      This buliding is large and confusing, but has reasonable
      maps inside.  Make sure you know the wing (letter) of the
      place you are going (not the same as entrance letters or lecture
      hall letters!).  In general, single letters are lecture halls
      that could be anywhere (use the maps), letter+number (e.g. Y123)
      is within that wing, and company names are lecture
      halls in U-wing.  Also, not everything connected on the upper
      levels: go to your wing first, then go up.
    lore: >-
      In 2016, this became the undergraduate center.  Previously, it
      was known as many things, among them the "main building".  Now,
      ACRE decided that Dipoli would be the main building.  This has
      made the name "main building" completly useless: if you ever say
      this, people will first think of this building, and maybe Dipoli
      second.  We all just agree that this will always be the main
      building, and Dipoli is always called Dipoli.

          Originally from "arkkitehtuuri", the architecture department.  Alvar Aalto,
          the architect who designed the building, only used white marble for this
          wing and the library to symbolize these being the only civilized parts of
          campus.

          use the door to the south of the main entrance, (up some

          or down from the Alvari restaurant, and connect from either
          the 0th or 2nd floor.  Good luck!

      This was originally built for the TKK student union, but they
      ran out of money partway through, so you can still see the
      "stairs to nowhere" going to the third floor.  The architecture
      here is quite unique - search and read about it some.  Aalto bought it
      some time ago, and in 2017 it opened as the new administration
      building.  In 2017, someone decided to call this the
      "Main Building", forgetting the fact that this makes the name
      meaningless: Otakaari 1 is(was) the "main building", and now no
      one can ever use the name "main building" without ambiguity.
      We all just agree: the undergraduate center will always be the
      main building, and we always call this building Dipoli.
      Actually, they tried to call Lämpömiehenkuja 2 the "main
      building", which absolutely no one not in the administration
      paid attention to.  Apparently the administration confuses
      "Administration" with "Main".

      consistent.  To get to 4th floor, you have to take the elevator
      or stairs within the x1xx wing, not the obvious glass elevator
      (just keep walking back and you'll find it)
    lore: >-
      If you know this building originally had the departments of
      Industrias Engineering and Management (TUotantotalouden = TUTA,
      still there) and Automation and Systems Technology (=AS, now merged
      with others), the name makes a lot of sense.
